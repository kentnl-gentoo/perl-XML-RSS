NAME
XML::RSS Version 0.9

DESCRIPTION
This module was created to help those who need to manage
RDF Site Summary (RSS) files. It makes quick work of
creating, updating, and saving RSS files.

XML::RSS currently supports 0.9, 0.91, and 1.0 versions of RSS.
See http://my.netscape.com/publish/help/mnn20/quickstart.html
for information on RSS 0.91. See http://my.netscape.com/publish/help/
for RSS 0.9 and http://purl.org/rss/1.0/.

Feel free to contact me at eisen@pobox.com if you have 
problems and/or suggestions.

REQUIREMENTS
This module requires version 2.23 or greater of the XML::Parser module.
The latest version is available at any CPAN archive.

You may have problems if you're using Perl 5.004. If you do, you'll
need to get the latest version of XML::Parser.

INSTALLATION
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

LIMITATIONS
-XML::RSS doesn't yet validate that the required elements exist before it
 generates the RSS file.
-Ignores the encoding defined in the XML declaration when using parse()
 or parsefile(). This is not intentional, I just haven't been able to
 get it to work yet.
-Same problem with the RSS version attribute as with encoding.
 
TROUBLESHOOTING
-If you get an error when using the parse() or parsefile() methods, your
RSS file is probably not valid XML. You must be sure to encode all XML
default entities.
