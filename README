NAME
XML::RSS Version 0.1

DESCRIPTION
This module was created to help those who need to manage
RDF Site Summary (RSS) files. It makes quick work of
creating, updating, and saving RSS files. It adheres to
the specification as it appears at:
http://my.netscape.com/publish/help/quickstart.html
which is actually quite useless since the site doesn't provide
a link to grab the official RDF schema. 

Furthermore, unless someone can prove me wrong, RSS is not
really XML, even though the above URL leads you to this
conclusion. I say this for 3 reasons:
1. The site states that RSS doesn't support UTF-8, a requirement
for well-formed XML.
2. The spec allows any of the HTML entities, but I haven't found
and external or internal entity declarations. So, if you put them
in, XML::Parser will croak.
3. It doesn't allow CDATA sections.

So, if you want to use this module, you must not use any HTML
entities. If you have some ideas on how to get around this,
please let me know.

Feel free to contact me at eisen@pobox.com if you have 
problems and/or suggestions.
