Revision history for Perl extension XML::RSS.

0.98_02 - Fri Jan 17 19:15:45 2003
	* changed the handle_char() routine to replace data rather than
	append to existing data.  this takes care of the doubling problem
	in the last issue.

	* set the RSS 2.0 namespace in the _initializer routine

	* all tests now pass.  if this works for people, it could turn into
	a release candidate

0.98_02 - Fri Jan 17 15:47:29 2003
	* added initial RSS 2.0 support
	* first fix to properly encode special characters in output
	* need to fix feature to add namespace (tests are TO DO)

0.4 - removed extraneous print
    - added stuff in examples/rss2html.pl
0.5 - fixed handle_char method which croaked on cdata
      that contained entities. Reported by 
      Wojciech Zwiefka <wojtekz@cnt.pl>
    - prettied up the output from rss2html.pl. It's
      now more suitable for including news feeds on
      a Web site. Also added ability to give local
      filename or http URL.
0.6 - numerous minor bug fixes
    - it no longer checks for size as specified by Netscape's RSS spec
      unless otherwise specified

	-fixed RSS 0.91 output. When the source file that is parsed was
         1.0, it did not properly translate all of the dc elements to
         0.91 channel elements.
0.97 Wed Mar 21 03:13:29 EST 2001
	-added support for the Taxonomy module (taxo). It only works

         form of the module syntax. See the XML::RSS documentation
         for examples.
